# Capstone Rating Guideline

There are 100 possible points for your capstone. it will be graded by the following five criteria:

## Presentation - *25 points*

How well did the team present their application? Was everything clearly explained? Was the presentation concise and engaging? Was the final product fully demoed?

## Architecture - *25 points*

Is there a backend and a frontend? How coupled are the two? If the backend went down, would the frontend go down as well? Was an MVC-like design pattern followed? How well defined are the service classes? Is there a form of persistence? Is the final product on GitHub? Is the final project on a hosting service like heroku?

## Code Completeness - *20 points*

Are all the appropiate components fully complete? Are the necessary operations and communications actually occuring between major code components and not just mocked?

## Agileness - *20 points*

How extensive was the use of the Scrum framework? Was a Scrum master assigned? Is there a meaningful deliniation of roles and responsibilities? Is there testing and is the testing meaningful?

## UX and UI - *10 points*

How clear is the UX/UI of the final product? Can someone with little knowledge of web-based applications utilize it effectively? How cohesive are the visuals? Was a css framework used and if so, is the final product better off for it?

---

Note that *UX and UI* has the least amount of points. While visuals are important, you are not expected to be designers. As such, the use of a CSS framework is highly encouraged!
